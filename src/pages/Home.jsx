                    Water pollution remains one of the most pressing environmental
                     issues, yet the core of the problem is the widespread lack of awareness.

                    Because this ignorance contributes to unchecked pollution, weak environmental policies,

                    Netfish is an engaging and thought-provoking game designed to raise awareness about ocean pollution and its impact on marine life. Players take on the role of a small fish navigating through increasingly polluted waters, dodging plastic and food waste.
                    As players progress, they witness firsthand the challenges marine creatures face due to human negligence. The game encourages environmental responsibility by highlighting the importance of reducing ocean waste and protecting marine biodiversity.
                    With stunning underwater visuals, immersive gameplay, and an eco-conscious message, Netfish is more than just a gameâ€”it's a call to action for a cleaner, healthier planet by raising the question: "Will you help save the ocean?"

Over the years, the rapid increase in tourism, urbanization, and economic activities has led to a dramatic rise in plastic consumption and waste generation on the island. Unfortunately, inadequate waste management infrastructure and improper disposal practices have contributed to the accumulation of plastic waste in Bali's environment, including its beaches, oceans, forests, jungle and urban areas."}/>
