                    Water pollution remains one of the most pressing environmental
                     issues, yet the core of the problem is the widespread lack of awareness.

                    Because this ignorance contributes to unchecked pollution, weak environmental policies,
                    and unsustainable human activities that harm aquatic ecosystems.
